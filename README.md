# Challenge 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This project was built to showcase my ability to supply a working Work Day Scheduler. To complete this I was tasked to use knowledge learned in week 5 along with the previous weeks. This meant the majority of this project was built using third party API's to complete this both functionally and stylistically.

When a user arrives for the first time they are greeted with a nice day scheduler that is empty and shows today's date at the top under the title. Depending on the time of day the text boxes are changed to various colors; green for future, red for current, and grey for past. The user can enter into the text area a note about their task and click the save button to save that task. If they wish to remove a saved task I went outside the requirements and added a delete button on the right of the save button which allows since hour entries to be removed as this is a great addition to this for more functionality. Additionally I added a button in the header that allows the user to clear the entire scheduler.
